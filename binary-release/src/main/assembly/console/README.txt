Contains 'console.war' binary which when deployed into the JBoss AS5 based server, should provide a 
'Management Console' for OpenMobster Platform.


The application is available via the following URL: http://<server>/console


To use the console, you must create an 'Admin' account. It is self-explanatory after that.


You can create multiple 'Admin' accounts. After the first account, all other accounts require approval by
another 'Admin' to use the console.
