# OpenMobster

> This is just an import from the official [OpenMobster](http://code.google.com/p/openmobster) project with a few enhancements to make it more cohesive to the [Ymir framework](https://github.com/ZalemSoftware/Ymir). The Zalem Software was not responsible for the architecture, design and programming of this platform, therefore all the credits goes to their original creators.
