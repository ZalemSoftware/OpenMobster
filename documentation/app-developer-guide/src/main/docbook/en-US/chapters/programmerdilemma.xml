   <title>Mobile Programmer's Dilemma</title>
   <sect1>
   		<para>
   		The <emphasis>Mobile Platform</emphasis> is a relatively new beast in the world of computer programming. For the longest time (atleast since 1996 that I know of), 
   		companies have tried to come up with ways to squeeze the power of the Internet into a device that conveniently sits in your pocket. 
   		After many stop and go linear approaches, one company changed the game. Apple with their iPhone release in 2006. A whole new <emphasis role="bold">Computer</emphasis>
   		with different architectural rules, and user expectations was born. The notion of native Apps was created. Even though "The Browser"
   		is a perfectly mainstream gateway to the Internet on a desktop, the same rule does not translate naturally to the mobile environment.
   		In fact that was the very reason why Mobile Internet has been the next big thing atleast for the last 15 yrs. Companies lazily expecting
   		their users to adopt "The Browser" on the mobile phone without realizing this is a completely different beast. Its a paradigm shift in
   		computer programming. The <emphasis role="">Mobile Computer</emphasis> is turning out to be the next step in evolution of the <emphasis>Personal Computer</emphasis>.

   		<title>WebApp ("Browser based") Development</title>
   		<para>
   		Web App Development involves accessing the Mobile App via a native browser located on the device. Programming can be done using standard web
   technologies like <emphasis>HTML, CSS, and Javascript</emphasis>>. Just like the <emphasis>PC</emphasis> world, the App executes completely on the server, while the mobile browser
   serves as a dumb terminal rendering just the UI. Some Javascript/Ajax approaches try to add some thickness to the architecture, but for the most
   part the App is fully reliant on the server and an active network connection.

   			<title>Disadvantages</title>
   			<para>
   				<itemizedlist>
   					<listitem>Not a very good user experience. The network latency on a desktop does not map equally to a mobile device. Users need information
   	  quick. Even a delay of a few milliseconds can result in frustration. Same pause on a desktop goes completely ignored.  
   					</listitem>
   					<listitem>
   					Web apps don't have the native look and feel which makes the user experience un-intuitive. Plus, each browser renders its content
   	   differently depending on the device, which can further add to frustration.
   					</listitem>
   					<listitem>
   					Does not allow access to all the low level services of the mobile platform that can deliver true innovation. Accessing remote data on the go
   					is not the only real advantage of this new computer. Its ability to feed context sensitive information back into the system
   					unlocks the potential for a whole new world of computing.
   					</listitem>
   					<listitem>
   					Some access via javascript and/or browser plugin is available, but it can never replicate the natural feel of accessing the low level 
   	     			platform API.
   					</listitem>
   					<listitem>
   					Too much dependence on a network connection. No offline access to critical data in the event of a network outage.

   		<title>App ("Native") Development</title>
   		<para>
   		Native App Development involves developing the App using the programming language and APIs provided by the native platform. It provides the most
  flexible approach to implementing complicated functionality and provide the best user experience possible. Here are some of the advantages
  of developing a native app.

   		In other words, whether to use the native approach or the web based approach is purely a business decision. For simple apps that only
 need to access data via a dumb terminal, native approach is overkill. For complex apps that fully utilize the power of the underlying platform, 
 a native app is the best route.

   		The <emphasis role="bold">OpenMobster Mobile Cloud Platform</emphasis> aims to deliver the low level infrastructure that provides services needed to build easy to use, innovative
 native apps. It takes away the hardwork of writing middleware infrastructure, so that the app developer can focus their development effort on
 implementing their business requirements. Here are some of the ways, OpenMobster tries to alleviate some of the disadvantages of native app development
 		<itemizedlist>
 			<listitem>The pluggable nature of the <link linkend="mobletmvc">Mobile MVC framework</link> makes it easier to port an app across multiple platforms. Most of the GUI level plumbing
 is provided by the Mobile Cloud runtime. Only thing that requires porting are the Screen and Command components that are implemented using
 the native programming language/API.
   			</listitem>
 			<listitem>
 			Having a consistent messaging spec across all the device level components. This makes the API features lot more consistent and only thing that
 varies across platform code is the syntax of the programming languge. 
 			</listitem>
 			<listitem>
 			Provide the same exact framework API in case where the programming languages are the same. For instance, Blackberry OS and Google Android are 
 based on the same 'Java' programming language. In that case the API of the various frameworks have the same exact syntax. This cuts down the
 porting effort dramatically. Only code that would require porting is the code that uses the low level platform API. 
 The code cannot be platform independent, but it can be <emphasis>language-portable</emphasis>.

   		<title>Back to the Future</title>
   		<para>
   		The ideal scenario would be to have a standard API/programming language across all platform for native apps. This is highly impractical considering
 we still have not achieved this in a desktop environment, and a mobile computer has many differentiating factors that prevent this from happening.
   		</para>
   		<para>
   		However, what is possible are native apps that use HTML, and CSS for the GUI presentation layer, and Javascript for event handling code. This
 is in fact possible in theory with HTML5. HTML5 aims at providing a standard for developing cross platform native apps, with all the features
 and services that are desirable for a native app. However, this is still
 an on-going effort at the spec level. HTML5 based native apps are probably a couple of years away from fruition.
