OpenMobster Cloud Platform provides a Maven based tool called AppCreator. AppCreator can be used by App developers to quickly develop, unit test, and debug mobile cloud apps written
on using the OpenMobster libraries. It greatly improves developer productivity by allowing them to quickly write and test components inside the development environment. There is no need
to fire up any App Server for running the Cloud. App Server integration is also provided when its time to deploy the Mobile App into production.

Some productivity features of AppCreator:

* Uses maven profiles to develop components for multiple mobile platforms within the same project

* In-VM unit testing as well as integration testing of Cloud components

* Development Mode device side runtimes

* Maven based repository management downloads latest libraries from remote repositories. Easy upgrades to the development environment

* Not an IDE. Eclipse is the IDE of choice. But maven works fully with other IDEs like IntelliJ.

Using the AppCreator:

* java -jar appCreator.jar

* AppCreation wizard prompts are self-explanatory

* Generates a multi-module maven project.
