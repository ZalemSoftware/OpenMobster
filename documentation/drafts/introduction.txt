Introduction to OpenMobster Mobile Cloud Platform

OpenMobster is a platform for integrating Mobile Apps (native/on-device apps) with remote data services located in the "Cloud"

It provides the following features:

* Seamless Offline Data Synchronization
  Cloud data is made available seamlessly inside an App's local storage. This data is available even if the device is offline and has no
  connection with the cloud. The data is automatically synchronized with the Cloud service based on state changes. These state changes
  are auto detected and does not require any device-side sync-related programming on the part of the developer
	
* Comet-style Push Notifications
  <ulink url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet_%28programming%29">Comet</ulink> is an umbrella term for pushing state changes to an App from the server,
  instead of an App proactively requesting it. The Push mechanism uses pure network/socket based approach instead of round about methodologies
  like sending sms alerts or email alerts. The Push notifications happens inside the App's address space. Note: some platforms like the iPhone
  do not allow background processing, and may need some workaround for the Comet Push. This is a limitation of the actual device platform.
  

* Simple Mobile Service RPC
  Provides a simple way of exposing your server-side coarse grained business services. These services are invoked via a simple RPC mechanism without
  any low-level programming like http-client code, client side REST library, etc on the part of the App developer. There is a simple
  RPC API that is used for making these calls. The RPC calls are synchronous in nature.
	

* Management Console
  A Management Console is provide to administrate the Cloud Server. It provides security, and account provisioning features. Over time the Management
  Console will carry device management features like remote wipe, remote tracking, remote lock-down, etc
