Title: Mobile RPC (Remote Procedure Call) Development

The MobileService component on the device side is used to make synchronous remote service invocations on registered MobileServerBean instances
on the Cloud Server.

At this time, this is a very simple request/response based system whose main design goal is to shield the App developer from any low level
details like making network connections, resolving remote services, marshalling/unmarshalling payload, protocol details, etc.


The next iteration of this component will involve introducing more robust features based on a REST-based architecture.

 
* Simple Tutorial

	Cloud Side: MobileServiceBean implementation
	MobileServiceBean is a simple interface with a single "invoke" method that needs to be implemented. This implementation should
	carry coarse grained business process logic.
	Sample Code:
	public Response invoke(Request request) 
	{	
		log.info("-------------------------------------------------");
		log.info(this.getClass().getName()+" successfully invoked...");		
		
		Response response = new Response();
		String[] names = request.getNames();
		for(String name: names)
		{
			String value = request.getAttribute(name);
			log.info("Name="+name+", Value="+value);
			response.setAttribute(name, "response://"+value);
		}		
		log.info("-------------------------------------------------");
		
		return response;
	}
	
	
	Step2: Provide the META-INF/openmobster-config.xml that will deploy the "MobileServiceBean" instance into the Cloud Server.
	Sample Configuration:
	<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
	<deployment xmlns="urn:jboss:bean-deployer:2.0">
   		<bean name="/demo/mobile-rpc" class="org.openmobster.core.examples.rpc.DemoMobileBeanService"/>
	</deployment>
	
	Step3: Package the the above classes and the corresponding META-INF/openmobster-config.xml into a simple Jar file.
	
	Step4: Deploy this jar file into the "deploy" directory of your JBoss AS instance
	
	Putting it all together: Entire Example MobileServiceBean is located at: 
	
	Device Side: 
	Sample Invocation code on the device:
	Request request = new Request("/demo/mobile-rpc");
	request.setAttribute("param1", "paramValue1");
	request.setAttribute("param2", "paramValue2");
		
	MobileService service = new MobileService();
	Response response = service.invoke(request);
