Title: Moblet MVC Framework

This is a thick client MVC (Model-View-Controller) framework. It is based on a 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rich_Internet_application">Rich Internet Application</a> design principle.
At this point in time of evolution of the mobile space, there isn't a commonly adopted GUI development standard across various
mobile platforms. This results in a lot of App porting activity across platforms. Although this framework
is not designed for (Write Once, Run Anywhere) approach, it abstracts out a lot of the UI Framework plumbing that would otherwise
need to be written, ported and maintained by the developer. The framework abstracts out some of the low level services into the container
such as App bootstrapping, screen navigation, graceful error handling, and internationalization. There are two types of components in this framework that
use a plugin mechanism and receive call backs to perform activities implemented using native platform API.

The MVC Framework provides the following features/benefit to an App developer:

* An abstraction from the different bootstrapping behavior associated with each native phone platform.

* A Command framework used for Event Handling. Abstracts platform-level details related to Event Dispatch Thread, background processing, etc.

* A Navigation framework used to help with screen navigation needs.

* A portable way to do "Internationalization".

* A context oriented "State Management" system used to handle View level state.
